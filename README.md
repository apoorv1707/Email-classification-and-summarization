# Email-classification-and-summarization
This project involves classifying emails and generating summaries to help users organize their inboxes and save time while reading their emails. This was done using various Neural Network models including Fully connected networks, RNN, GRU, LSTM, and an Encoder-Decoder model. 

This project contains 4 code files.
First file is the text_BERT file which reads in the text data and converts into BERT embeddings.
Second file is the NN_classification file which has 15 neural network models. It also has email dataset cleaning and using best performing NN classifying the emails.
Third file is text_summarization file which contains code for text summarization model and summary generation.
Fourth file is summary_evaluation file in which summaries are evaluated using rouge scores.
